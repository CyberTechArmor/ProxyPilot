// Mock2 runner PURE decision layer (Phase M6, ADR-003; survey §8). Native-free,
// unit-tested stub-first (risk R9). The RUNNER is the provider-agnostic agentic
// loop that execs into a fenced M4 container, makes a targeted change, runs the
// pinned gates, and checkpoints. Everything about that loop that can be decided
// without a model API, better-sqlite3, or Incus lives here: the tool schemas the
// build_runner slot is offered, the system-prompt assembly from the PINNED
// framework content (ADR-003), and the small per-step decisions.
//
// model-client.js (the network half) and runner.js (the host/exec half) import
// these; the tests import ONLY this module.
//
// Terminology (risk R7): the AI build component is the runner; the slot that
// drives it is build_runner. Nothing here — or anywhere in M6 — is named "agent".

// The runner's tool set, as provider-neutral JSON-Schema tool definitions.
// model-client.js maps these onto each provider's tool-calling shape (Anthropic
// `tools`, OpenAI `functions`, Gemini function declarations). The runner
// EXECUTES these against the fenced container (exec/file) or the pinned gates
// (run_gates); the model only requests them.

1. Read the relevant files to understand the current state.
2. Make the smallest change that satisfies the requested task. Do not refactor,
   add features, or touch anything the task did not ask for.
3. Call run_gates. If any gate is red, fix the cause and run them again.
4. When every gate is green, call finish with a one-line summary. Do not call
   finish before the gates are green.

Make the change; call finish only when the gates are green.`;
