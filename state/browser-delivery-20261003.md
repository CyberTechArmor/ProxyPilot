# Browser delivery tracker

| Item | Status | Evidence / deployment | What I should see or be able to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source and host baseline | Verified | Live dashboard/agent cad71e96f6; clean source checkout | Known running build and unchanged existing A3/A4/A7 services |
| Fixed runtime installation controls | Deployed | PR732, all three CI workflows passed; deployment 62fbe678-8f9a-4c8b-87f3-70cda056492d | Profile → Application settings → Browser runtime: Install, Recover, Roll back |
| Invoke and verify runtime installation | Blocked | New MCP tool absent from this session catalog; cloud browser signed out | Needs callable manage_browser_runtime or authenticated cloud UI; no separate terminal required |
| Subsequent package delivery | Deployed | PR733; all three CI workflows passed; deployment 233d0b85-916b-442c-9881-d951a879044d | Ordinary app update preserves committed runtime; explicit installer replaces it |
| Public navigation and live view | Not started | Last runtime status: separate_runtime_package_required | No non-demo browsing or live-view acceptance claimed |
| Plain-language model tasks | Not started | Real provider/execution proof pending | Review generated task, execute and cancel |
| Manual authentication and action authorization | Not started | Separate capabilities | Sign in privately and return control |
| Files and internal destinations | Not started | Separate capabilities | Explicit supported file/internal journeys |
| Visual batches | Not started | Browser delivery precedes approved-mockup reconciliation | Individually deployed UI changes |

Baseline: pinned Mock2 1.14.0 guidance. Historical checkouts and unrelated state
preserved; all work uses the cloud clone and authorized infrastructure.

PR732's first deployment exited 75 at the existing systemd lifetime transition
check; the next invocation rebuilt successfully. No Incus upgrade occurred.
Installation controls passed local rendering at 360/375/768/1280/1920 pixels with
simulated API data; live authenticated UI interactions remain unverified.

PR733 first CI attempt failed Chromium's initial Target.setDiscoverTargets after
30 seconds. That execution path is unchanged by PR733. Failure remains in GitHub
job 111262200848; a single failed-job rerun passed unchanged, followed by all remaining checks.
The cause is unproven; no timeout was increased. Real-host installed-runtime
update compatibility remains unverified until installation is possible.
